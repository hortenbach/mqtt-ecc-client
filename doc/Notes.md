 *  The esp32 WiFi programming model can be depicted as following picture:

 *                             |             |\     API call
 *                             |             |
 *                             |-------------|
 *
 * The WiFi driver can be consider as black box, it knows nothing about the high layer code, such as
 * TCPIP stack, application task, event task etc, all it can do is to receive API call from high layer
 * or post event queue to a specified Queue, which is initialized by API esp_wifi_init().
 *
 * The event task is a daemon task, which receives events from WiFi driver or from other subsystem, such
 * as TCPIP stack, event task will call the default callback function on receiving the event. For example,
 * on receiving event SYSTEM_EVENT_STA_CONNECTED, it will call tcpip_adapter_start() to start the DHCP
 * client in it's default handler.
 *
 * Application can register it's own event callback function by API esp_event_init, then the application callback
 * function will be called after the default callback. Also, if application doesn't want to execute the callback
 * in the event task, what it needs to do is to post the related event to application task in the application callback function.
 *
 * The application task (code) generally mixes all these thing together, it calls APIs to init the system/WiFi and
 * handle the events when necessary.
